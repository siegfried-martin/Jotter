# Test Coverage Goals

## High Priority Coverage (Must Test)

### Authentication System (100%)
- Login/logout flows
- Session persistence
- Protected route enforcement
- Error handling (network, auth failures)

### Data Integrity (95%)
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Cache consistency
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Auto-save reliability

### Core User Interactions (90%)
- Section creation and editing
- Container management
- Collection navigation
- Drag and drop operations

## Medium Priority Coverage (80%)

### Editor Functionality
- Content serialization/deserialization
- Editor-specific features (syntax highlighting, formatting)
- Copy to clipboard operations
- Keyboard shortcuts

### UI Components
- Form validation and submission
- Modal dialogs and confirmations
- Responsive layout behavior
- Loading states and error boundaries

## Lower Priority Coverage (60%)

### Nice-to-Have Features
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts
- Bulk operations
- Export functionality
- Performance optimizations

### Edge Cases
- Network interruption recovery
- Browser compatibility quirks
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent user scenarios

## Coverage Exclusions

### Third-Party Libraries
- Excalidraw internals
- Quill editor internals
- CodeMirror functionality
- Supabase SDK behavior

### Generated Code
- Build artifacts
- Auto-generated types
- Configuration files

## Measurement Strategy

### Automated Coverage
- Integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage reports generated on every PR
- Minimum thresholds enforced
- Historical trend tracking

### Manual Testing Areas
- Visual design verification
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device testing
- Accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria
- No critical bugs in production
- <5 minute test suite execution
- Easy test maintenance and updates
- Clear test failure diagnostics
